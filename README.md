# Genetic and geographical delineation of zoonotic vector borne helminths of canids
Several zoonotic vector-borne helminths (VBHs) infesting canids cause serious veterinary and medical diseases worldwide. Increasing the knowledge about their genetic structures is pivotal to identify them and therefore to settle effective surveillance and control measures. To overcome the limitation due to the heterogeneity of large DNA sequence datasets used for their genetic characterization, we provide here a pipline for phylogenetic analysis on all available cox1 and 12S  from GenBank at January 2022.

# Key input and output files used in the present study

Three folders are provided for the 12S, cox1 and MLST phylogenitic analysis. Each of them containing the following:

# Files used to generate the ML phylogeny and phylogenitic placement

> REFMSA--12S.fasta: Multi-sequence alignement on selected reference sequences

> Query--12S.fasta: Multi-sequence alignement on all query sequences available from GenBank at January 2022.

> TREE features.txt: iqtree output file

> epa_result--cox1.jplace: EPA-ng output file for phylogenitic placement of query sequences.


# Annotation files used to annotate the tree within iTOL software

> Labels.txt: Sequence labels 

> Species delimitation.txt: Result of species deliitations algorithms

> alignement.txt: alignement of informative sites

> epidemio_multibar.txt: descreptive statistics showing the distribution of sequences according to the isolation source
